0	Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
4	You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo, 
6	Before You visit him, to make inquiry 
8	Of his behaviour.
12	Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir, 
14	Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris; 
16	And how, and who, what means, and where they keep, 
18	What company, at what expense; and finding, 
20	By this encompassment and drift of question, 
22	That they do know my son, come you more nearer 
24	Than your particular demands will touch it: 
26	Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him; 
28	As thus, 'I know his father and his friends, 
30	And in part hi;m;--do you mark this, Reynaldo?
34	'And in part him;--but,' you may say, 'not well: 
36	But if't be he I mean, he's very wild; 
38	Addicted so and so;' and there put on him 
40	What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank 
42	As may dishonour him; take heed of that; 
44	But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips 
46	As are companions noted and most known 
48	To youth and liberty.
52	Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling, 
54	Drabbing:--you may go so far.
58	Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge. 
60	You must not put another scandal on him, 
62	That he is open to incontinency; 
64	That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly 
66	That they may seem the taints of liberty; 
68	The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind; 
70	A savageness in unreclaimed blood, 
72	Of general assault.
76	Wherefore should you do this?
82	Marry, sir, here's my drift; 
84	And I believe it is a fetch of warrant: 
86	You laying these slight sullies on my son 
88	As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, 
90	Mark you, 
92	Your party in converse, him you would sound, 
94	Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes 
96	The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd 
98	He closes with you in this consequence; 
100	'Good sir,' or so; or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'-- 
102	According to the phrase or the addition 
104	Of man and country.
108	And then, sir, does he this,--he does--What was I about to say?-- 
110	By the mass, I was about to say something:--Where did I leave?
116	At--closes in the consequence'--ay, marry! 
118	He closes with you thus:--'I know the gentleman; 
120	I saw him yesterday, or t'other day, 
122	Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say, 
124	There was he gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse; 
126	There falling out at tennis': or perchance, 
128	'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'-- 
130	Videlicet, a brothel,--or so forth.-- 
132	See you now; 
134	Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth: 
136	And thus do we of wisdom and of reach, 
138	With windlaces, and with assays of bias, 
140	By indirections find directions out: 
142	So, by my former lecture and advice, 
144	Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
148	God b' wi' you, fare you well.
152	Observe his inclination in yourself.
156	And let him ply his music.
160	Farewell!
