162	How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
166	With what, i' the name of God?
184	Mad for thy love?
190	What said he?
220	Come, go with me: I will go seek the king. 
222	This is the very ecstasy of love; 
224	Whose violent property fordoes itself, 
226	And leads the will to desperate undertakings, 
228	As oft as any passion under heaven 
230	That does afflict our natures. I am sorry,-- 
232	What, have you given him any hard words of late?
240	That hath made him mad. 
242	I am sorry that with better heed and judgment 
244	I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle, 
246	And meant to wreck thee; but beshrew my jealousy! 
248	It seems it as proper to our age 
250	To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions 
252	As it is common for the younger sort 
254	To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king: 
256	This must be known; which, being kept close, might move 
258	More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
