164	Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
168	My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber, 
170	Lord Hamlet,--with his doublet all unbrac'd; 
172	No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd, 
174	Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle; 
176	Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other; 
178	And with a look so piteous in purport 
180	As if he had been loosed out of hell 
182	To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
186	My lord, I do not know; 
188	But truly I do fear it.
192	He took me by the wrist, and held me hard; 
194	Then goes he to the length of all his arm; 
196	And with his other hand thus o'er his brow, 
198	He falls to such perusal of my face 
200	As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so; 
202	At last,--a little shaking of mine arm, 
204	And thrice his head thus waving up and down,-- 
206	He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound 
208	As it did seem to shatter all his bulk 
210	And end his being: that done, he lets me go: 
212	And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd 
214	He seem'd to find his way without his eyes; 
216	For out o' doors he went without their help, 
218	And to the last bended their light on me.
234	No, my good lord; but, as you did command, 
236	I did repel his letters and denied 
238	His access to me.
